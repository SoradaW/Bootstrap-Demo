# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Working with advance CSS Bootstrap Portfolio

This repository demonstrate a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework from the very beginning.

My gold for the project:

1. To demonstrate HTML and advance CSS that I have learned so far
2. To learn and practice with Bootstrap
3. To practice GitHub commit, using the mantra “commit early and often.”
4. To practice a clear and descriptive in commit messages
5. To grow my knowledge and able to developing of my portfolio page
6. To upgrade my portfolio to be more interactive and resposive
* Please note I have completely re-arranged my portfolio layout. 
* All images for demonstration purposes only
